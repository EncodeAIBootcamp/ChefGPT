# ChefGPT

ChefGPT is a bot which accepts one of the following inputs:
 - A list of a dish ingredients
 - A dish name
 - A dish recipie

The prompt in the script respond to three different possible inputs: suggesting dishes based on ingredients, giving recipes to dishes, or criticizing the recipes given by the user input.

If the user passes one or more ingredients, the AI suggests a dish name that can be made with these ingredients.

If the user passes a dish name, the AI should give a recipe for that dish.

If the user passes a recipe for a dish, the AI should criticize the recipe and suggest changes.
